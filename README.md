# Google Maps Platform

The API key is a unique identifier that authenticates requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes. You must have at least one API key associated with your project.

## Creating API keys

To create an API key:
1. Go to the **Google Maps Platform > Credentials** page.
2. On the **Credentials** page, click **Create credentials > API key**.
   The **API key created** dialog displays your newly created API key.
3. Click **Close**.
   The new API key is listed on the **Credentials** page under **API keys**.

## Adding the API key to your request

You must include an API key with every Maps JavaScript API request. In the following example, replace **YOUR_API_KEY** with your API key.

HTTPS is required for requests that use an API key.
